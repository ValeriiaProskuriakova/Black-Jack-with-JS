        <p>The computer generates random cards, and each card contains a certain number of points.<br>
          Ace is 11; Jack, Lady and the King are 10, and the rest of the cards' signs correspond to the points they contain.<br>
          When the player has more than 21 points, 
          the round is done, and the player loses 20$. <br>
          In case of 21 points (Black Jack), player's money is doubled.
