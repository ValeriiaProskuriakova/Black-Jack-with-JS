# Black-Jack-with-JS
<pre>
Light version of a Black Jack game (very light:) built on JavaScript
###
If you get more than 21 points, you lose 20$, and if you get 21 poits, 
your money is doubled, but only in case you have more than 0.
If you have 0, it remains 0 if you lose, but in case you have 21, you receive a 200$ prize.
